## Project Tracker
A simple Project Tracker with functionality to Read/Write to a Google Spreadsheet or local file

### Using Google
If you want to save the data to a google spreadsheet [follow](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/dotnet) the .NET guide
for the Google Sheets API and get a credentials.json and save it to where the other files are.
~~And edit in Program.cs the lines 23,24 and 52,53.~~
Added an Settings Menu to edit the Spreadsheet id and edit area.
### And dont forget thw minimum width for the edit area is 3 columns

And now you're pretty much good to go. Im open for any ideas and improvements for the programm.
